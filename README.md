# ClinVarPredictionModel

This project is an exercise in building ensemble models using multiple methods and handling noisy data. The goal was to improve performance of the model, as measured by F score, compared to the work done on kaggle.
A common problem the Kaggle submissions failed to address was overfit of data and bias due to class imbalance.

Using a multilayer heterogenous ensemble model and robust data shaping and cleaning to cut through noise, I was able to take the dataset below and outperform all submissions by the proposed metric.
